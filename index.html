      Karla Mari McKanders, (Prof., Law, U. of Tennessee College of Law), University of Arkansas
      at Little Rock Law Review, Summer 2009, p. 597. Traditionally, immigration has been defined
      as the determination of admission, exclusion and the conditions under which immigrants can
      remain in the country. "In reality, however, Congress has much broader power over immigrant
      and alienage law and policy, including the ability to regulate, 'the conditions of residence such
      as access to education, welfare and employment.'" When Congress passed the IRCA in 1987,
      it extended its authority from regulating the entrance and exit of immigrants to also regulating
      immigrants' employment conditions. Also, pursuant to federal regulations the United States
      Citizenship and Immigration Services determines which immigrants are permitted to work.
      Congress has plenary power over immigration law, which means that courts have traditionally
      deferred to congressional authority in making decisions regarding immigration law. The
      dispute over state and local regulation begins when there is an overlap between states'
      traditional police powers to regulate the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and the federal
      government's regulation of education, welfare and employment of immigrants while in the
      United States.

    <p>  In 2018, there were 28.2 million foreign-born persons in the U.S labor force, compromising 17.4 percent of the total.
​

     (77.9% versus 67.3%), while foreign-born women were less likely to participate than native-born

  <p> The median usual weekly earnings of foreign-born full-time wage and salary workers were $758
in 2018, compared with $910 for their native-born counterparts.(Differences in

  <p> For unaccompanied minors from Central American countries, 2014 was the biggest year. Overall, 68,541 minors entered through the southwestern United States border. This amount was almost double the amount in 2013. In 2015, the numbers dropped to 39,970, and rose again in 2016 with 59,692 unaccompanied minors arriving.

      <p>   Many of the immigrant children from El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico are escaping extreme violence, often gang-related and fueled by the drug trade. A 2013 report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees indicated that 63% of the immigrants from El Salvador, 43% of Hondurans, and 32% of Mexicans cited violence in society (mostly gang-related violence) as the reason for leaving. Violence in the home was another strong motivator, with statistics standing at 63% for El Salvador, 24% for Honduras, and 17% for Mexico. "Salvadoran and Honduran children ... come from extremely violent regions where they probably perceive the risk of traveling alone to the U.S. preferable to remaining at home," the report said. Guatemalan children cited deprivation (29%), violence in the home (23%), and violence in society (20%) as reasons for leaving their countries. Children in Honduras also cited poverty as reasons for leaving, while many girls from El Salvador reported fear of both home and gang-related sexual abuse.
  <p> In 2014, one in five births (791,000) in the United States was to an immigrant mother (legal or illegal).
  Our best estimate is that legal immigrants acounted for 12.4 percent (494,000) of all births, and illegal immigrants accounted for 7.5 percent (297,000). The 297,000 births per year to illegal immigrants is larger than the total number of births in any state other than California and Texas. It  is also larger than the total number of births in 16 states plus the District of Columbia, combined.

<div id="Laws" class="tabcontent">
  <p>U.S. immigration law is very complex, and there is much confusion as to how it works. The Immigration and Naturalization Act, the body of law governing current immigration policy, provides for an annual worldwide limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants, with certain exceptions for close family members. Lawful
  permanent residency allows a foreign national to work and live lawfully and permanently in the United States. Lawful permanent residents are eligible to apply for nearly all jobs and can remain in the country even if they are unemployed. Each year the United States also admits noncitizens on a temporary basis.</font> </p></center>
  <p>Immigration to the United States is based upon the following principles: the reunification of families, admitting immigrants with skills that are valuable to the U.S. economy, protecting refugees, and promoting diversity. This fact sheet provides basic information about how the U.S. legal immigration system is designed.</font> </p></center>

    <p>United States v. Wong Kim Ark[5]
    The Supreme Court ruled that a child of Chinese descent born in the United States - whose parents at the time of his birth are subjects of the Emperor of China but who are domiciled in the United States as permanent residents; are carrying on business there; and are not employed in any diplomatic or other official capacity under the Emperor of China - is a citizen of the United States by virtue of having been born "in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," per the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
    Several years later, in the wake of the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake and Fire, a number of Chinese immigrants who were otherwise subject to the Chinese Exclusion Act were nonetheless able to claim American citizenship by alleging they were born in San Francisco, and that their birth certificates had been destroyed along with those of everyone else who had been born in San Francisco. "Papers for fictitious children were sold in China, allowing Chinese to immigrate despite the laws." [1]

    Total annual immigration was capped at 150,000. Immigrants fit into two categories: those from quota-nations and those from non-quota nations.
    Immigrant visas from quota-nations were restricted to the same ratio of residents from the country of origin out of 150,000 as the ratio of foreign-born nationals in the United States. The percentage out of 150,000 was the relative number of visas a particular nation received.
    Non-quota nations, notably those contiguous to the United States only had to prove an immigrant's residence in that country of origin for at least two years prior to emigration to the United States.
    Laborers from Asiatic nations were excluded but exceptions existed for professionals, clergy, and students to obtain visas.

    <p>Federal officials deported "Tens of thousands, and possibly more than 400,000, Mexicans and Mexican-Americans... Many, mostly children, were U.S. citizens." [7] "Applications for legal admission into the United States increased following World War II — and so did illegal immigration." [8] Some used fraudulent marriages as their method of illegal entry in the U.S. "Japanese immigration became disproportionately female, as more women left Japan as "picture brides", betrothed to emigrant men into the U.S. whom they had never met."

    The court also stated that illegal immigrants are "within the jurisdiction" of the states in which they reside and, therefore, are under the equal protection laws of the fourteenth amendment, and stated, "We have never suggested that the class of persons who might avail themselves of the equal protection guarantee is less than coextensive with that entitled to due process. To the contrary, we have recognized [457 U.S. 202, 212] that both provisions were fashioned to protect an identical class of persons, and to reach every exercise of state authority."

    The court reiterated the finding of Kwong Hai Chew v.

But while an alien lawfully enters and resides in this country he becomes invested with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution to all people within our borders".
    Stated, "those cases in which aliens have been determined to enjoy certain constitutional rights establish only that aliens receive such protections when they have come within the territory of, and have developed substantial connections with, this country. See, e. g., Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 212 ."

    Post 9/11/2001 An estimated 3.1 million immigrants entered the United States illegally between 2000 and 2005.[15]
    From 1998 to 2001, Mexicans accounted for 68% of immigrants who entered the United States illegally. That percentage jumped to 78% for the years between 2001 and 2005, mostly due to stricter security measures that followed the September 11, 2001 Attacks upon the United States (which more efficiently prevented illegal entry from nations that did not share a land or maritime boundary with the United States).[18]

    <h3>Visa Backlogs</h3>

    <p>How many visa applications for permanent immigration (green cards) are backlogged?</p>

      In February 2019, the U.S. government was still processing some family-sponsored visa applications dating to August 1995, and employment-related visa applications from August 2007. According to data on the petitions submitted to the State Department, there were about 3.8 million applicants (including spouses and minor children) who were on the waiting list as of November 1, 2018, the first time the backlog dropped in recent years.The overwhelming majority of backlogs were family-sponsored applicants (3.7 million, which includes the principal applicant and their immediate family members). About 121,000 were employment-sponsored applicants and their families. Of the overall 3.8 million applicants, 1.2 million were citizens of Mexico, followed by those from the Philippines (314,000), India (299,000), Vietnam and China (with 232,000 each). Family- and employment-based prospective immigrants who are waiting to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident from within the United States are not included in the State Department estimate. USCIS also publishes backlog statistics but only for petitions approved in one of the five employment-based categories. USCIS data show that close to 395,000 approved employment-based immigrant petitions were awaiting a priority date based on the May 2018 Department of State Visa Bulletin. The figure corresponds to the number of primary applicants covered by these petitions but excludes their dependents. To MPI knowledge, USCIS did not publish backlog statistics on other types of green card applications the agency adjudicates. In other words, the overall number of people waiting for a green card—within and outside of the United States is likely to be larger than the 3.8 million reported by the State Department (as of November 2018) and 395,000 reported by USCIS (as of May 2018).
